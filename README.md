Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository 
This repository contains my Machine Learning practice, projects, and implementations built while learning ML concepts and applying them to real-world problems.


.I created this repo to:

Strengthen ML fundamentals
Practice Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
Build real-world projects
